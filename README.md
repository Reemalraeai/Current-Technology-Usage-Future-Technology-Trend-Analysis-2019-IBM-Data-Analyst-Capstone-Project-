# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project


•	This project is a part of IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate.

•	In this project, I analysed data from an online survey 2019 of software professionals across the world conducted by Stack Overflow to get insights into current technology usage & future technology trend.

•	I used SQL & Python to perform data wrangling & exploratory data analysis (EDA) via Jupyter Notebook. 

•	The python libraries I used are NumPy, Panadas, & Matplotlib.

•	Finally, for data visualization I used IBM Cognos Dashboard Embedded, and Microsoft PowerPoint for data presentation. For this project, I performed the data analysis via IBM Cloud & IBM Watson


Here is the final Dashboard:
